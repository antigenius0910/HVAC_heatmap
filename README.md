Using graphite to create a heatmap

Graphite is very easy to use and can create all kind of graphic for you, but one thing missing is heatmap.
which make it hard for people who would like to track down individual items and get a whole picture all at the same time.

For example: If I would like to track down temprature of 8 servers. I am using binary hplog from hp-health.rpm. I can use graphie to generate below temprature from these 8 servers. It will look like this.
